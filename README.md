## About browserexploit:
```
BrowserExploit is an Electron application that uses a JavaScript WebSocket Backdoor to connect to the listener.

The JavaScript backdoor in BrowserExploit can be used on all browsers that support WebSockets. 
It will not have access to the Electron API of the host computer unless the BrowserBackdoor Client application is used.
